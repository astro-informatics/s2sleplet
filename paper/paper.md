# Summary

# Statement of Need

# Research Based on SLEPLET

`SLEPLET` has been used in the development of the sifting convolution [@Roddy2021], and Slepian scale-discretised wavelets on the sphere [@Roddy2022] and manifolds [@Roddy2023].

# Acknowledgements

The author would like to thank Jason D. McEwen for their advice and guidance on the mathematics behind `SLEPLET`.

`SLEPLET` makes use of several libraries the author would like to acknowledge, in particular `SSHT` [@McEwen2011], `S2LET` [@Leistedt2013], and `libigl` [@Libigl2017].
