`SLEPLET` is a Python package for the construction of Slepian wavelets in the
spherical and manifold (via meshes) settings. The API of `SLEPLET` has been
designed in an object-orientated manner and is easily extendible. Upon
installation, `SLEPLET` comes with two command line interfaces - `sphere` and
`mesh` - which allows one to easily generate plots on the sphere and a set of
meshes using `plotly`.
